Certainly! I'll create a GitHub Pages description for both the technical and non-technical circles websites. This description can be used in your README.md file or as part of your GitHub Pages site to introduce and explain the projects.



Here's a description you can use for your GitHub Pages:

# Interactive Department Circles

Welcome to our Interactive Department Circles project! This repository hosts two interactive web pages designed to showcase different departments and technical domains in an engaging and visually appealing manner.

## 1. Non-Technical Departments

Our first interactive page focuses on non-technical departments within an organization. It features five key areas:

- Human Resources (HR)
- Public Relations (PR)
- Social Media
- Graphic Design
- Content Writing

Each department is represented by a colorful, interactive circle. Hover over a circle to reveal more information about the department and what you can expect when joining the team.

## 2. Technical Domains

Our second interactive page highlights 13 technical domains, covering a wide range of IT and computer science fields:

1. CyberSecurity
2. Malware Analysis
3. AI/ML
4. Data Science
5. Cloud
6. DevOps
7. Linux Administration
8. Windows Administration
9. Flutter
10. Web Development
11. Computer Networks
12. Network Security
13. Penetration Testing

Similar to the non-technical page, each domain is represented by an interactive circle. Hover over a circle to learn more about the specific technical area and its focus.
